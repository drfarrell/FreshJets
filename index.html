        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p><br>This project was an exploration of how to redesign their "How It Works" section of their website. Their initial design consisted of a full-screen jumbotron-carousel that made it excruciating to scan through the content. I wanted to boil down their explanation of their product to a single screen, reducing clicks and maximizing visitor retention.<br><br>The only constraints for this redesign were to use the preexisting logo and photography while creating a strong ethos for attracting high-end customers. I interpreted this as shifting the brand away from the stereotypical flat-look that startups tend to have. In other words, to establish trust in the company and emphasize tasteful, forward-thinking design for the company.<br><br></p>

        <p><br><br>My approach started with the idea that this would be on their "About" section of the company website, and that it would be important to emphasize their mission before presenting a step-by-step breakdown of their product. As for the steps, I thought a card approach would be scaleable and offer some opportunity for creativity in presenting the necessary information. Click and hover-effects over the cards were also options with this approach, but it turned out that–other than sorting a stack of the cards–there wasn't much functionality or content behind letting the user click the card, so that idea was scrapped.<br><br>
          Towards the end of the first sketch page I started getting caught-up in how the design of the cards should look. I had to slow down and separate what the necessary information was from what I wanted to add as accents to the card. It turned out that the cards themselves didn't need to be very elaborate, so I changed my perspective, and approached the cards horizontally.<br>

      <div class="commentary">
        <p><br>Having decided to use horizontal cards, I thought of ways to flatten the top "Mission" section to sit more comfortably with the new design. Perhaps I wasn't making the mission bold enough in the early iterations, so I increased the size (and pride) of the title. Doing so had a great grounding effect on the intersection of both parts (mission and steps) of the page while making the ethos of the mission more convincing.<br><br>As you may have noticed in the previous wireframes, there's a large photo of a private jet that sits on two of the designs. I found a great HD photo to use and I was looking for a good place to put it. The difficulty with using it was orienting it in relation to the rest of the content while maintaining balance on the screen. Planes are heavy, and this one was no exception. I ended up pointing it towards the details of the mission statement halfway between the ground and the sky to tie the distinct halves of the page together.<br><br>
          Choosing to do the horizontal cards opened-up a creative opportunity to try a kind of boarding-pass for each step, but doing so made the card too complex and distracting for the result I was looking for. I decided to spend time balancing the information I wanted to present, weighing the positioning of the step number and text in relation to the photo. The photos were heavy, and I needed to balance them out with some level of subtle detail or font-size balance. I did a combination of both, spreading the number of the step in the counter-corner and increasing the weight of the step title. Adding the "Experience Guide to Freshjets" gave just enough weight to the left side to even-out the page. I dashed the upper line to solidify the copy-side and hint at the signature dashed lines we culturally associate borders and lines on paper travel maps with. 
          <br><br>To dive into the font pairing and color selection: the logo has a serif monogram of "fj" and a sans serif title, so a font pairing that used both styles was ideal. Open Sans and PT Serif turned out to be a great pairing for the job that bridged the idea of a startup and a classy service. A light blue was the initial accent color of the company, but I decided to use that specific hue for distinguishing a different division of the company (to be uploaded in a different project). I also found that blue is absurdly common in airline branding, and considering that most photos of air travel will feature some portion of sky, flat gold would be a unique option. I initially worried that the flat gold would be too close to getting "lost" on the white background, but it looks great on most shades of gray yet maintains intentional legibility on a flat white. <br><br></p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><br>
          The final design achieved the initial goal of bringing a new, more sophisticated look to the private jet startup. To critique the design, I think setting the entire project on a subtle white-to-grey gradient may have reduced the legibility of the final step. Using a white background would have been better. The font size of the copy text clashes a little with the title, so it may be a bit more appropriate to either decrease its size or condense and shrink the title. The transition between the mission and "How It Works" may be a bit too stark considering it goes from solid asphalt to bright white. The positioning of the photos could be a little bit higher so that they sit in the middle of the card and level with the serif step numbers, although it does make an interesting zig-zag motion for scanning the content of the page. Although this was mostly a visual redesign of the existing Freshjet copy and photography, I'm glad I got to try a serif and sans-serif font pairing while flushing-out a higher-end brand.<br><br>
